This is an attempt to get a simple l10n library for modern browsers.
The point is mainly to test the HTML syntax and the JS API before choosing a
suitable data format (see last section).

Quick Start
-----------

L10n resource files are linked to the HTML document like this:

```html
<link rel="resource" type="application/l10n" href="data.properties" />
<link rel="resource" type="application/l10n" href="mobile.properties"
      media="screen and (max-width: 640px)" />
```

l10n.js currently relies on the ``*.properties`` format, which is used in most
Mozilla and Java projects. It is bullet-proof but limited (= key/value pairs),
and we’re working on a more advanced alternative.
